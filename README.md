<p>With my love of canoeing and backwoods camping I believe there is nothing more important a person can do with thier life than taking care of the earth and every creature on it</p>
<p>That's why for the past six years I've been studying to pivot my career in the natural resources and conservation sector. I have a minor in Forest Biomaterials Science and A Certificate in Geographin Information Systems for Environmental Management both from the University of Toronto. GIS is a powerful tool that helps us not only understand the world around us but can also help us predict the future and what actions we must take to protect it.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is a collection of samples from my work. These are largely projects that I have completed for my Certificate in GIS.</p>

<h2>Clustering of Pollutants in Canada</h2>
<p>This layout analyzes the clustering of various types of pollutants in Canada. I also include a table with statistical measures of clustering and it's likelyhood.</p>

<h2>Forest Fire Spread</h2>
<p>This layout calculates the spread of a fire from the ignition point of Camp Site 40. I used cost analysis accounting for varying elevation, vegitation, streams, wind and I sample how the fire would have spread at different times of the day as it progressed. I also accounted for the changing horizontal wind factor as wind speed and direction change throughout the day.</p>

<h2>Different Ways of Representing Elevation</h2>
<p>This shows the area of Joker's Hill Park, The four different map frames show different ways of representing elevation. The DEM is the raw elevation data in a raster format with a stretch symbology applied to the elevation in metres. The second map frame shows Standard Deviation, this illustrates the rate of change in elevation with the higher valued areas being steeper. The third uses Inverse Distance Weighting, which used sample points to interpolate surrounding elevation. The third is a Triangulated Irregular Network which used the same elevation sample points as the IDW plus hard line elevation data from a streams elevation layer to create a polygonal almost 3D network of triangles. each mothod having their advantages, disadvantages and use cases.</p>
