<p>With my love of canoeing and backwoods camping I believe there is nothing more important a person can do with thier life than taking care of the earth and every creature on it</p>
<p>That's why for the past six years I've been studying to pivot my career in the natural resources and conservation sector. I have a minor in Forest Biomaterials Science and A Certificate in Geographin Information Systems for Environmental Management both from the University of Toronto. GIS is a powerful tool that helps us not only understand the world around us but can also help us predict the future and what actions we must take to protect it.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is a collection of samples from my work. These are largely projects that I have completed for my Certificate in GIS.</p>

<h2>Clustering of Pollutants in Canada</h2>
<p>This layout analyzes the clustering of various types of pollutants in Canada. I also include a table with statistical measures of clustering and it's likelyhood.</p>

<h2>Forest Fire Spread</h2>
<p>This layout calculates the spread of a fire from the ignition point of Camp Site 40. I used cost analysis accounting for varying elevation, vegitation, streams, wind and I sample how the fire would have spread at different times of the day as it progressed. I also accounted for the changing horizontal wind factor as wind speed and direction change throughout the day.</p>
