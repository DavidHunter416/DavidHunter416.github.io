<p>With my love of canoeing and backwoods camping I believe there is nothing more important a person can do with thier life than taking care of the earth and every creature on it</p>
<p>That's why for the past six years I've been studying to pivot my career in the natural resources and conservation sector. I have a minor in Forest Biomaterials Science and A Certificate in Geographin Information Systems for Environmental Management both from the University of Toronto. GIS is a powerful tool that helps us not only understand the world around us but can also help us predict the future and what actions we must take to protect it.</p>

<p>Here is a collection of samples from my work. These are largely projects that I have completed for my Certificate in GIS</p>

<h2> School and Noise Contour</h2>
<p>This layout compares the distance of Local Schools to an airport where the sound take offs and landing could be particularly disruptive. Schools within the Noise Contour should be considered for improved sound isolation measures.</p>
