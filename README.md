<p>With my love of canoeing and backwoods camping I believe there is nothing more important a person can do with thier life than taking care of the earth and every creature on it</p>
<p>That's why for the past six years I've been studying to pivot my career in the natural resources and conservation sector. I have a minor in Forest Biomaterials Science and A Certificate in Geographin Information Systems for Environmental Management both from the University of Toronto. GIS is a powerful tool that helps us not only understand the world around us but can also help us predict the future and what actions we must take to protect it.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is a collection of samples from my work. These are largely projects that I have completed for my Certificate in GIS.</p>
